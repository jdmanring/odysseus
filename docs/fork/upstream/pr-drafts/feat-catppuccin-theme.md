## Title

`feat(theming): add Catppuccin Mocha theme`

---

## Description

### Problem

Odysseus ships 16 built-in themes but has no Catppuccin option. Catppuccin is a widely-used, well-designed color palette with a strong community following.

### Solution

Add a `catppuccin` theme using the Catppuccin Mocha palette with a mauve accent:

| Property | Color | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Background | `#1e1e2e` | Mocha base surface |
| Foreground | `#cdd6f4` | Mocha text — soft, readable lavender-white |
| Panel | `#181825` | Mocha surface0 |
| Border | `#5b6078` | Mocha overlay0 |
| Accent/Red | `#8565d1` | Mauve — distinctive accent that differentiates from other themes |

The default theme remains `dark` — catppuccin is an opt-in choice.

### Files Changed

- `static/js/theme.js` — added `catppuccin` entry to `THEMES` export

### Notes

- Single-line addition — no default theme change, no breaking changes
- Colors from the official Catppuccin Mocha palette (https://catppuccin.com)
- Compatible with the existing custom theme engine, color picker, and background effects
- No changes to theme scheduling, persistence, or UI

### How to Test

1. Start the server (`docker compose up -d --build` or `uvicorn app:app`).
2. Open the app; go to Settings → Appearance → Theme.
3. Select "Catppuccin" from the theme list. Verify the theme name appears in the dropdown.
4. Confirm the background shifts to `#1e1e2e`, text to a soft lavender-white, and the accent color is a purple-mauve (not the default red).
5. Open a conversation and send a message — verify syntax highlighting in code blocks renders correctly with the new palette.
6. Switch to another theme (e.g. "dark") and back — confirm no bleed-through or broken state.
7. Reload the page — confirm the selected Catppuccin theme persists.

**Screenshots required** — this is a visual theme change:
- [ ] Screenshot of the theme picker with "Catppuccin" selected and visible
- [ ] Screenshot of the main chat view with the Catppuccin theme active (showing background, sidebar, and chat area colors)
- Attach via drag-and-drop in the GitHub PR form
